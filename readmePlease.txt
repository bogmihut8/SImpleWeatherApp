Description
  A simple weather app that shows the temperature and the condition of a searched city.

Features
  - search field for weather
  - recent searches in a dropdown
  - option to select recent searches to show the weather
  - search for a city using the hash of the website (http://weatherapp-domain.com#London will show you the weather in London, without displaying the inputs)

Observation
  - this is just a simple app implemented in 5 - 6 hours
  - lacks proper front-end validation
  - done using reactive.js template(I had no previous experience with this framework before starting this app)
